        <li><em class="clientFeedback">“ We brought in <strong>Degel</strong> to help us speed up a graphics subsystem on a Java port to handheld device. When they made it run<strong > nearly twice as fast</strong>, we were really impressed! Since then Degel has helped us with key pieces of more projects, doing <strong >top-quality work</strong> and helping us reach deadlines. These guys are true professionals, and they're a pleasure to work with.”</em>

        <span class="lineSpace"></span>
        <li><em class="clientFeedback">“ We worked very closely with Degel to implement some new desirable features and we are glad we did so. Degel's implementation of our requirements resulted in one of <strong >the most featured and usable</strong> Talk Now clients we have, and this was no mean feat given the problems with integrating low-level hooks into a series 60 platform.”</em>
          <p><span> Mick Angel </span> <span>Application Design Manager</span> <span> Orange Voice Services Specification and Design</span></p>

        <li><em class="clientFeedback">“ I strongly recommend David and his very dynamic team, Degel, for their <strong >great ability to develop reliable, complex software</strong> that get included in some of the best-selling applications available on Symbian OS platform.”</em>

        </li>
        <span class="lineSpace"></span>
        <li><em class="clientFeedback">“ I have worked with David for the last two years, while he led Degel, to another cycle of growth. Degel is one of those companies that managed to quickly move in too the forefront of the most advanced knowledge, running much faster then many others. David as the company leader, managed to create an amazing brand, and achieve some quite <strong >impossible technology challenges</strong>.”</em>

        </li>
        <span class="lineSpace"></span>
        <li><em class="clientFeedback">“ It was a pleasure working with Degel Software to develop our NaturalRecorder application. From the beginning of development until the release of the final version they have always been very <strong >professional, reactive and always nice</strong>! Most important they have a good (and rare) feeling for what makes a good application. We were pleasantly surprised that all the little choices they made (that were not included in the original specification) were always perfect, giving our application a professional and nicely finished touch.”</em>

        <span class="lineSpace"></span>
        <li><em class="clientFeedback">“ David's company did an outstanding job in bringing our application to the Symbian platform. I have used many off shore development firms, and unlike David's firm mostly without good success. Degel Software is <strong >dependable and produced high quality work</strong>. I strongly recommend them for handheld development.”</em>

        </li>
        <span class="lineSpace"></span>
        <li><em class="clientFeedback">“ We were real pleased when Degel helped us show off our proprietary technology by building a smart, customizable web interface that enabled us to produce a compelling demo and <strong >secure a critical round of financing</strong>. Degel supplied us with technology which is outside of our mainstream, but was essential at this phase of our development. When we need this kind of development again, we're <strong >happy to know that Degel will be there for us</strong>.”</em>
