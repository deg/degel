      <h3>ABOUT DAVID GOLDFARB <img src="assets/images/client/david.jpg" alt="" class="img-rounded pull-right" > </h3>
      <p>I started Degel Software way back in 1988, shortly after I graduated from MIT and
      moved to Israel.</p>
      <p>Since then, my focus has been to help companies, large and small, leverage new
      technologies to jump-start their business.</p>
      <p>Over the years, Degel has been through many technology cycles. Sometimes I've worked
      by myself, sometimes managing a local team; and sometimes working with talented
      international developers. Only one thing remains constant: a focus on offering
      highest-quality cutting-edge software solutions.</p>
      <span class="lineSpace"></span>
      <h3>THE HISTORY OF DEGEL SOFTWARE LTD.</h3>
      <p>From Internet TCP/IP protocols all the way through to today's cutting edge
      applications, I've enjoyed riding the waves of commercial software development.</p>
      <p>I founded Degel in 1988. It has grown into multiple development teams and segued into
      two start-ups, one still publicly traded (VRNG); but has always retained my push for
      excellence at its core.</p>
      <p>Over the years, I've specialized in graphical user interfaces, artificial
      intelligence, image processing, multimedia, internet protocols, multi-player games,
      mobile app development, patent strategies, biotech, cutting-edge languages, etc. At every
      stage, I've prided myself on being able to guide my clients in the directions they needed</p>
      <p>I received a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Massachusetts Institute of
      Technology (MIT) in 1984. A native New Yorker, I hold dual American/Israeli citizenship.
      Since the mid 1980s, I have lived in Israel, but travel frequently to clients around the
      world.</p>
      <p>Degel Software is me, but it's more than me.</p>
      <p>Over the years, Degel has included multiple like-minded developers; sometimes working
      in my basement, sometimes in "real" office space, and often scattered around the world in
      virtual offices.</p>
      <p>In 1996, we co-founded 2AM Inc., an early Internet games company that created
      innovative games through 2000.</p>
      <p>In 2006, Degel was an early and leading mobile apps developer. (We had started
      by optimizing J2ME for Sun in 2001 and went on to create AOL's ICQ and IM mobile
      messaging clients for Symbian and J2ME). We segued these skills into founding
      Vringo, where we focused on video ringtone pesonalization/sharing and eventually
      IPO'd as VRNG (now FH).</p>
      <p>Today, I focus on working directly with clients, helping them innovate in areas as
      diverse as internationalization tools and biotechnology.</p>
